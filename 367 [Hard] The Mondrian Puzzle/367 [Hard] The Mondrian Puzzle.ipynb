    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The artist Piet Mondrian is a famous mid-century abstract artist. His designs of brightly colored rectangles on a canvas should be familiar to you even if you don't know his name. He's even given his name to a visual programming language Piet.\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned about this puzzle from this video from TED-Ed on the challenge. Briefly:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Fit non-congruent rectangles into a n*n square grid. What is the smallest difference possible between the areas of the largest and the smallest rectangles?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember a non-congruent rectangle is a shape with distinct measurements, so a 8x1 rectangle is the same as a 1x8, but distinct from a 2x4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge today is to write a program that can heuristically subdivide the canvas and find a minimal area range.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sequence A276523 in the OEIS database.\n",

    "## Output Description\n",
