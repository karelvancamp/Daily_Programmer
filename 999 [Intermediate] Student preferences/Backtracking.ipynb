    "# Problem:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I am a teacher and every year we have overnight excursions where we have to organize rooms for around 100 students.\n",
    "    However there are a number of requirements when organise these rooms:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Boys and girls MUST be in seperate rooms\n",
    "    Room sizes and amount of rooms will vary. e.g. \n",
    "    This year we might have 4x '5 bed' rooms and 7x '4 bed' rooms, however, \n",
    "    we may have restrictions on this so all the boys rooms are together etc..\n",
    "    Each student allocates 3 students they would like to share with,\n",
    "    and we promise to get them at least 1 of their friends.\n"

    "# Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Considerations:\n",
    "    Every room will contain at least 1 strongly connected component (SCC) with 2 or more elements,\n",
    "    otherwise it's impossible to have a valid room.\n",
    "    This SCC serves as central node with possible other nodes pointing towards it in treelike branches \n",
    "    It is possible there is more than one SCC in a room\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Also, consider the possible forms of SCC. \n",
    "    These will often contain cliques of size 2,3 or 4. \n",
    "    For example when 4 friends all choose each other, they form a clique of 4.\n",
    "    This group could be unconnected to the general graph.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    In theory this problem could lack a solution. \n",
    "    In practice there will be always be many close friends who pick eachother.\n",
    "    These can be used to seed to trees as needed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## First approach: brute force\n",
    "    Only feasible for very small problem sizes, \n",
    "       \n",
    "## Second approach: backtracking    \n",
    "    Fill each room at random using chaining on preferences.\n",
    "    (this disregards some possibilities as it prevents multiple SCC hubs)\n",
    "    When a room is full, check if last element if connected to any other\n",
    "    if so: explore next room\n",
    "    else: close branch\n",
    "        \n",
    "    For all valid solutions, calculate a solution value, this can be used to find the optimal solutions.\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Third approach: backtracking corrected\n",
    "    The previous approach lifts out the chaining, due to the possible existinence of isolated cliques of size 4.\n",
    "    So chaining preferences should be ignored, and only checked when the room is full.\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Fourth approach: graph backtracking\n",
    "    Each room should contains at least 1 hub. \n",
    "    So use this as a seed, than grow tree inside room backwards. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    If during backtracking a room is left unfilled, seed with a new hub if possible. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Fifth approach: graph heuristic\n",
    "    As the problem size = 100\n"
